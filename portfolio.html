            <h3>Project 1</h3>
            <p>My First Project is about creating a Heart disesase detector using Machine Learning Algorithms and Data Science. This project presents several machine learning approaches for predicting heart diseases, using data of major health factors from patients. The paper demonstrated four classification methods: Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Naïve Bayes (NB), to build the prediction models. Data preprocessing and feature selection steps were done before building the models. The models were evaluated based on the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The SVM model performed best with 91.67% accuracy.

            <h3>Project 2</h3>
            <p>My Second Project is about creating a exercise and health webpage .This project is build using Html,CSS,Javascript and Bootstrap.The homepage features a large hero image that showcases the studio’s signature barre-inspired workouts. The website is also well-organized, with easy-to-navigate menus and clear call-to-action buttons. One of the most notable features of the Stacy Lel Fitness website design is its use of a soft color palette. The website uses shades of Edgewater and bluish-gray, which create a calming and relaxing atmosphere. This color palette is also consistent with the studio’s brand identity, which is all about providing a supportive and welcoming environment for its clients. Another notable feature of the Stacy Lel Fitness website design is its use of high-quality images and videos. </p>
